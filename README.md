## About the concept

- [Andrej Karpathy on X](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) - "There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. (.) I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works".
